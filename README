This is the Czech video game review website Zabij 10 prasat, live at:
http://zabij10prasat.cz

It's essentially a specialized CMS written in Flask (Python microframework)
with support for labels (tags), media, ratings, reactions, and more.
It's unlikely that more progress will be made on the software.

Apologies about the password storage.  I know better today, and hardly
anybody registered, anyway.

The name z20p comes from it being the second version of Z10P (Zabij 10 prasat).
The first version was written in PHP.
